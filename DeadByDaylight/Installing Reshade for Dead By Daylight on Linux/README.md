The important part is the folder you specify to install. 

  First run the curl command from the below repo:
    https://github.com/kevinlekiller/reshade-steam-proton
  
  Continue until prompted to enter the Game path and enter:
    ~/.local/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Dead by Daylight/DeadByDaylight/Binaries/Win64/

Set the launch option as instructed by the script, run the game, then press the HOME key on your keyboard to open. 

Let me know if this helps.
